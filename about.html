        <h3>Git started</h3>   
        <hr>  

 <!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->         
        
        <h4>Intro</h4>
                               
            <p>This app aims to be a user-friendly revision control software. 
                It fits people working on their own projects, or that find git overwhelming. 
            </p>
                               
            <p> The app uses "git" behind the scene, and is therefore fully compatible and 
                can be used interchangeably together with other git softwares.
            </p>  
        <hr>          

 <!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->             
        <h4>Help</h4>
                               
            <p>Help for the main window is found from the  <img style='vertical-align:middle;' src="images/questionmark_black.png"  height="17" width="17">  icon. 
            </p>
                               
            <p>Instructions for windows that are opened outside the main windown are found at the bottom of each window, and can be read by clicking on the banner :

         <h4>Start working - drop a folder</h4>
            
            <p>Dragging a project's folder onto the app's window makes it available for version control.  
            </p>       
            
            <p>If the folder is not prepared (as a git repository), the user is asked to allow the program to initialize the folder for git.
            </p>

         <h4>Beginner's workflow</h4>
             <p>For git first-timers, the workflow would simply be: 
             <ul>
                <li>Work on your files</li>
                <li>When finished with some task: write a description in the text area, and press the "Store" button to store a snapshot of your files</li>
                <li>Work on your files</li>
                <li>When finished with some task: write a description in the text area, and press the "Store" button</li>
                <li>...</li>
             </ul>  
            </p>    
             
            <p>The beauty of the revision control is, that you may go back to any snapshot later
            </p>

                        You can create a new branch from where you are, or from a historical snapshot (see section "Log, History", below). 
                        You cannot create a new branch if you have changed files that are not stored.

                        There are two different types of conflicts: 1) a file was deleted in one of the two places, and 2) a file was changed in the same place on both places.
                        For both this cases, git needs your help to decide on what you wish to do.  This process is called "resolving a conflict", and in Pragma-git there is a tool
                        that aids you in doing this</td>

                        If you work on multiple computers, or are many people in the team, some work may have been performed and stored on the remote repository.
                        "Pull" is a way to update your local project folder to the latest state. It is good practice to do this before you start working on your local project.</td>

                        In Pragma-git, the default is to do a "push" when pressing the "Store" button.  
                        This may be turned off in the settings, and then you need to do a manual push when ready to copy to the remote repository.
                        In Pragma-git, you send the data to a remote branch with the same name as your local branch.</td>

                        A stash takes you back to a clean last-snapshot, and keeps the changes in memory. Sometimes this can be useful. 
                        One such occasion is if you forgot to "pull" from the remote repository,
                        before starting to work in your local folder.  Doing a "stash", then "pull", and then "stash-pop" would be a workflow to solve such problem.
                        In Pragma-git "stash" works  as the computer clipboard's copy command, and can hold only one stash. </td>

            displays the name of your current repository (in this example "MyFolder"), and the name of the current branch (in this case "master").
            Both the repository, and the branch names can be clicked to cycle through your repositories and branches, respectively.
            </p>

            shows the number of modified files. In normal mode, it is the difference since the last Store operation.  In history mode, it is the change from the previous revision in history.
            Clicking on this area opens a list of modified files in a new window.
            In this new window, you can see if a file was added, modified or deleted.  You may also investigate how the files were changed viewing the differences, and in the normal mode also delete or restore the changed file.

            This may happen under special circumstances after a "merge", "pull" or "stash retrieve" action.  
            What it means is that Pragma-git needs your help to clarify what is your intention with files changed in different ways in two different locations.

         <h4>Store version with short description </h4>
             <p>
                When you feel you have reached an important point in your work (or are just afraid you will get lost if you continue) 
                you may store a named revision of the project. The nice thing about the revision control system is, 
                that you can later retrieve your whole project as it was at this point in time. There is no harm to store revisions often.
            </p>
                    
            <p>
                To store a revision of the changed files, you click in the text field, and type a descriptive text. The Store button  
                <img style='vertical-align:middle;' src="images/store-button.png"  height="24" > becomes active when you start typing.  Press this button to store your revision.

            <p> The description may be more than one line. If you use multiple lines, 
                the first line is a brief description (like a title). The next line is an empty line. 
                The following lines contain a more specific description. Example :<br>
            </p>

         <h4>Multiple repositories and branches </h4>    
             
            <p><u>Repositories</u> : You can have multiple active project folders (repositories), added by drag-and drop as described above. 
                You switch by clicking the name (the first text in the title bar), to change to next project in the list.
            </p>
            
            <p>Repositories can also be created by cloning from an existing remote repository (see Instructions section, at the 
            settings page  <img style='vertical-align:middle;' src="images/questionmark_black.png"  height="17" width="17">).
            </p>
            
            <p>Repositories can also be removed from the list in the program, also that from the settings window  <img style='vertical-align:middle;' src="images/questionmark_black.png"  height="17" width="17">).
            </p>
                                      
            <p><u>Branches</u> : You can have multiple branches of your work, that you can switch between. 
                You switch by clicking the name (the second text in the title bar between parentheses), to change to next project in the list.
            </p>           
             <p>Branches can be created from the Settings dialog icon <img style='vertical-align:middle;' src="images/settings_black.png"  height="17" width="17">,
                where a new branch can be created from the top of your current branch, or from a checked-out historical commit.
             </p> 
             
             <p>  
                Branching can also be performed with the <img src="images/branch_black.png"  height="17" width="17">  button (which is available if all working files are stored). 
                With this button, a branch may be created starting from the commit displayed in the main window (the latest Store, or a historical commit)
                
                
                
                
                <!-- TODO: branches may also be hidden, which makes sense if you have many branches you don't use.  -->

          <h4>History, and checkout </h4>    
             
            <p><u>Browsing history</u> : As described above, the arrow buttons let you browse back in time.
            </p>
            
            <p>When you view an old commit, the "Store-button" is changed into a "Checkout" button.  
            Pressing "Checkout" sets the files in the project to the same state as it was when Stored. This is useful if you wish to test your work as it was at this time point.
            If you don't modify any of the files, you are fine to change branch, and you will be back to where your project was before.
            </p>
            
            <p><u>Peculiarity with git</u> : If you, however, change any of the files in a historical checkout, your files will be in a strange state called "detached HEAD"
            </p>
                       
            <p><u>Detached HEAD branch</u> : The branch-name in the title bar is changed to "HEAD", which in git language is referred to as a "detached HEAD".
            That means, that once you move to another branch, the detached branch can't be easily found again.  
            </p>
            
            <p><u>Modified files in HEAD branch</u> : 
            If you have modified any files from this checkout and want to keep your changes, you need to move those changes to another branch.
            </p>
                        
            <p><u>Not Stored files</u> : The easiest way to do move modified (but not Stored) files from a detached HEAD is : 
                <ol>
                    <li>Press the stash button <img 'vertical-align:middle;' src="images/stash_black.png"  height="17" width="17"> </li><br>
                    <li>Click on the branch name (HEAD), until you are at the branch where you wish to add your changes to</li><br>
                    <li>Press the retrieve stash button <img 'vertical-align:middle;' src="images/stash_pop_black.png"  height="17" width="17"></li>
                </ol>
            </p>
            
            <p><u>Stored files</u> : If you have modified and Stored files originating from a checked-out historical commit (what git calls "from a detached HEAD") : 
                <ol type='i'>
                    <li>Click on the branch name (HEAD) </li><br>
                    <li>A dialog pops up, and asks if you wish to <br>
                        1) Create a temporary branch, to save the files, or <br>
                        2) Delete your changes
                    </li><br>
                    <li>If you select to 1) create a temporary branch, your work will be saved in a branch named "temp-branch-" followed by a number. 
                    Change branch to where you wish the new work to be added, and then click the merge button <img src="images/merge_black.png"  height="17" width="17"> </li>
                </ol>
