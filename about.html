        <h4>Intro</h4>
                               
            <p>Pragma-git aims to be a user-friendly revision control software. 
                It fits people working on their own projects, or that find git overwhelming. 
            </p>
                               
            <p> The app uses "git" behind the scene, and is therefore fully compatible and 
                can be used interchangeably together with other git softwares. It requires set-up of git (see <a href="#INSTALLATION">Installation</a>).
            </p>  
        <hr>          

 <!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->             
        <h4>Help</h4>
                               
            <p>Help is found from the  <img style='vertical-align:middle;' src="images/questionmark_black.png"  height="17" width="17">  icon. 
            This icon also appears in many opened windows.
            </p>

        <hr>          

 <!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->             
         <h4>Start working</h4>           
            
            <ul>
                <li>Drag and drop a project's folder onto the app's window. </li> 
                <li>If the folder is not already prepared (as a git repository), please allow the program to initialize the folder for git. </li> 
            </ul>
            
            
            <p>Alternatively, if you want to work on a cloned project, cloning is performed from the settings menu.
            </p>

         <h4>Beginner's workflow</h4>
             <p>For git first-timers, the workflow would simply be: 
             <ul>
                <li>Work on your files</li>
                <li>When finished with some task: write a description in the text area, and press the "Store" button to store a snapshot of your files</li>
                <li>Work on your files</li>
                <li>When finished with some task: write a description in the text area, and press the "Store" button</li>
                <li>...</li>
             </ul>  
            </p>    
             
            <p>The beauty of the revision control is, that you may go back to any snapshot later
            </p>

                When you feel you have reached an important point in your work (or are just afraid you will get lost if you continue) 
                you may store a named revision of the project. The nice thing about the revision control system is, 
                that you can later retrieve your whole project as it was at this point in time. There is no harm to store revisions often.

            <p>
                To store a revision of the changed files, you click in the text field, and type a descriptive text. The Store button  
                <img style='vertical-align:middle;' src="images/store-button.png"  height="24" > becomes active when you start typing.  Press this button to store your revision.

                the first line is a brief description (like a title). The next line is an empty line.

            <p><u>Repositories</u> : You can have multiple active project folders (repositories), added by drag-and drop as described above. 
                You switch by clicking the name (the first text in the title bar), to change to next project in the list.
            </p>
            
            <p>Repositories can be created by cloning from an existing remote repository (see Instructions section, at the 
            settings page).
            </p>
            
            <p>Repositories can also be removed from the list in the program, also that from the settings window.
            </p>
                                      
            <p><u>Branches</u> : You can have multiple branches of your work, that you can switch between. 
                You switch by clicking the name (the second text in the title bar between parentheses), to change to next project in the list.
            </p>           
             <p>Branches can be created from the Settings dialog icon <img style='vertical-align:middle;' src="images/settings_black.png"  height="17" width="17">,
                where a new branch can be created from the top of your current branch, or from a checked-out historical commit.

             <p>  
                Branching can also be performed with the <img src="images/branch_black.png"  height="17" width="17">  button (which is available if all working files are stored). 
                With this button, a branch may be created starting from the commit displayed in the main window (the latest Store, or a historical commit)

            <p><u>Browsing history</u> : As described above, the arrow buttons 
            (<img style='vertical-align:middle;' src="images/down-arrow_hover.png"  height="17" width="17"><img style='vertical-align:middle;' src="images/up-arrow_hover.png"  height="17" width="17">) 
            let you browse back in time.
            Also, a graphical representation can be viewed by clicking the icon  <img style='vertical-align:middle;' src="images/more_black.png"  height="17" width="17">
            </p>
            
            <p>When you view an old commit, the "Store-button" 
            <img style='vertical-align:middle;' src="images/store-button.png"  height="20"> 
            is changed into a "Checkout" button
            <img style='vertical-align:middle;' src="images/checkout-button.png"  height="20">. 
             
            Pressing "Checkout" sets the files in the project to the same state as it was once, when Stored. This is useful if you wish to test your work as it was at this time point.
            If you don't modify any of the files, you are fine to change branch, and you will be back to where your project was before.
            </p>
            
            <p><u>Peculiarity with git</u> : If you change any of the files in a historical checkout, your files will be in a strange state called "detached HEAD"
            </p>
                       
            <p><u>Detached HEAD branch</u> : The branch-name in the title bar is changed to "HEAD", which in git language is referred to as a "detached HEAD".
            That means, that once you move to another branch, the detached branch can't be easily found again.  
            </p>
            
            <p><u>Modified files in HEAD branch</u> : 
            If you have modified any files after this checkout and want to keep your changes, you need to move those changes to another branch.
            </p>
                        
            <p><u>Not Stored files</u> : The easiest way to move modified (which are not Stored) files from a detached HEAD is : 
                <ol>
                    <li>Press the stash button <img 'vertical-align:middle;' src="images/stash_black.png"  height="17" width="17"> </li><br>
                    <li>Click on the branch name (HEAD), until you are at the branch where you wish to add your changes to</li><br>
                    <li>Press the retrieve stash button <img 'vertical-align:middle;' src="images/stash_pop_black.png"  height="17" width="17"></li>
                </ol>
            </p>
            
            <p><u>Stored files</u> : If you have modified and Stored files originating from a checked-out historical commit (what git calls "from a detached HEAD") : 
                <ol type='i'>
                    <li>Click on the branch name (HEAD) </li><br>
                    
                    <li>A dialog pops up, and asks if you wish to <br>
                        1) Create a temporary branch, to save the files, or <br>
                        2) Delete your changes

        regardless if the current commit is newer or older than the fixed commit.  This eliminates the 
        problem that the same file can be marked as new or deleted in a comparison between two commits, depending on which of the two commits was fixed.

            <p><u>Git</u> : The code relies on a standard installation of git 
                (<a href='https://git-scm.com/downloads' onclick="require('nw.gui').Shell.openExternal( this.href );return false;">download link</a>).

            <p><u>Setup</u> : 
                Your name and email should also be added, which you do from the "Software section" on the
                settings page <img src="images/settings_black.png"  height="17" width="17">.
            </p>    
                    
            <p><u>Diff and Merge tool</u> : 
            Pragma-git contains its own diff and merge tool.
            If you have your favorite Diff and Merge tool it may be used instead.  
            The tool is added to Pragma-git in the settings window.</p>
