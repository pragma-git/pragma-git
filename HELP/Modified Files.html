            <p><b>Check-boxes </b>:<br>
            Pragma-git assumes that you wish to store all files you are working with.  
            This saves one step that most other git clients put on the user -- to explicitly choose that you want to add files.
            </p>
            
            <p>If you wish to skip files from next storage, deselect their check boxes, and press "Update Selection" button</p>
                  
            <p>Following the next Store operation, the skip list is cleared, and again the assumption is that you wish to store all files</p>
            
            <p><b>Other file operations </b>: </p>     
              
            <p>Apart from selecting files to skip, there are a number of actions to perform on the file:</p>
            <p><b>(diff)</b> opens the diff viewer, and shows the change between the file you work on, compared to the last Store operation</p>
            <p><b>(restore)</b> restores the file to the state last Stored <br>(a warning dialog will pop up, since this will loose the changes you have made to the file)</p>
            <p><b>(delete)</b> deletes the file <br>(a warning dialog will pop up, since this will loose the changes you have made to the file)</p>
            
            
            <p>Not all options are available for every type of change.  
            For instance, if a file is new there is no old file to compare with; and if a file is deleted there is no new file to compare with the old. 
            Therefore the "diff" linke will not be visible.
            The same logic goes with "restore", which can only be done if the file has been stored before; and with "delete" which can't be done on an already deleted file</p>
