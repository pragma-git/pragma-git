 <h4>Current branch</h4>       
    <p>
    The commit tree shows commits on the current branch in green <img style="height: 12; width: 12; filter: invert( 0% ); vertical-align:middle;" src="../images/circle_green.png" >
    , and commits on other branches without color <img style="height: 12; width: 12; vertical-align:middle;" src="../images/circle_black.png">. 
    Selection in the graph window are synchronized with the main window.
    </p>  
    
    <p>  Due to how git works, the current branch can only be deduced correctly if the settings "Merge without fast-forward" is used (recommended).
    </p>  

<h4>Text color</h4> 
    <p>
    Commit message texts outside the current branch are displayed in <i>italics</i> and a diffent color. 
    Also, commits not found in the Search box (of the main window) are displayed in <i>italics</i> and a diffent color.
    
        <p>


<h4>Navigating</h4> 
    <p>
    Moving the mouse pointer over the commit message, a grey shaddow appears, together with a checkbox <img src="../images/pinned_disabled_black.png"  style="height: 17; width: 17; vertical-align:middle;">.
    <p>


<h4>Select commit</h4>     
    </p>
    Clicking on the commit makes the text green, and moves history to the selected commit.  The main window is updated to display this commit.  
    The main window can be used as before, looking for changes, clicking on the modified files to get a list of changes to prior commit, etc.
    <p>
   
<h4>Compare with fixed commit</h4>    
    </p>
    Clicking the checkbox <img src="../images/pinned_disabled_black.png"  style="height: 17; width: 17; vertical-align:middle;">
    , makes the checked commit a fixed historical commit (<img src="../images/pinned_enabled_black.png"  style="height: 17; width: 17; vertical-align:middle;">). 
    </p>
    
    <p>
    Selecting the text of any other commit (not the checkbox) 
    moves history to the newly selected commit (both in graph and in main window).
    The bottom of the main window is updated to display number of modified files between the selected and the fixed (checkboxed) commits. 
       </p>

<h4>Dates</h4>     
    </p>
    <input id="showDate" name="showDate" type="checkbox"> <label for="showDate">Show Date</label>
    , enables or disables display of commit date (git's "author's date") .  
    </p>
    
    <p>
    One date is shown per day, and newer commits are higher up.  Dates are shown in ISO format, with YYYY-MM-DD (YYYY = four digit year, MM = two-digit month, DD = two-digit day)
    <p>
