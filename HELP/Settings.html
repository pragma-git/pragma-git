<hr>    
 <!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->  

    <p>The repository settings have two parts : 
        <dl>
            <dd><b>A : Repository table </b> , where you may select one of the repositories you have defined </dd>
            <dd><b>B : "Branches in selected repository" table</b> , which shows the branches that exist in the selected repository  </dd>
        </dl>     
    </p>
    
    <hr>                
    <!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->     

    <h3>A - part I : The "Repository table"  &mdash;  top rows</h3> 
    
        <p>All rows, except the last row, shows the settings for the repositories you have defined so far. </p>
        
        <p><b>The first column</b> "Local folder" shows the path to your active repositories, on your local pc.  The radio-button, can be used to select one 
        row, and the second table below shows the branches in that selected repository</p>
        
        
        <p><b>The second column</b> "Remote repository" shows the address to a connected remote repository.  If this is not defined, then you work with a local repository (
        which is fine as long as you have a backup plan)</p>
        
        <p><b>The third column</b> has the "Set" button, which is used to test that the remote repository can be connected to, and at the same time storing the address</p>

        <p><b>The forth column</b> has the "Forget" button, which is used remove the selected row from the list 
        (it can always be added again, just as you did the first time by dropping the folder on the main window)</p>

    <!--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------> 
    <h3>A - part II : The "Repository table", cloning  &mdash;  last row</h3>  
    
        Instead of starting with a local folder, you may connect with an existing repository (this process is called cloning).
        
         <p><b>Setting up clone </b> is very similar to adding the remote repository, above.<br> 
        The cloning is set up in the last row of the "Repository table", and you define a local folder and the repository address from which you wish to copy. 
        
        </p>
        
        <ol>
        <li><b>The "Folder" button </b> is used to select the folder, into which the cloned repository is copied.  
        <li><b>The  text field in the "Remote repository" column </b> is used to define the remote repository address (url)   
        <li><b>The  "Test" button </b> is used to verify that you can connect to the defined remote repository  
        <li><b>The  "Clone" button </b> makes a copy of the remote repository in the selected folder, and connects your local copy to the remote repository
        </ol>

    <h3>Some words about remote repositories</h3>  
    
    It is already described, above, how you link your project to a remote repository; and also how you clone a remote repository to your local computer.
    This section describes how to set up user-names and passwords for remote repositories.

        
     <h4>Creating an account </h4> 
         
         
         <p>There are multiple remote repository hosting services that you can use on internet. One popular site is 
            <a href='https://github.com' onclick="require('nw.gui').Shell.openExternal( this.href );return false;">Github</a> (by Microsoft), which gives free accounts.    
         </p>
         
        <p> Get an account, go to the web interface, and create a new repository.  
            You will get a link on the format 
            <code style = "margin-left: 15px"> https://github.com/JanAxelssonTest/test.git</code> <br>
            which you need to copy.    
        </p>
        
        
     <h4>Using your link (address / url) </h4> 
         
                                        
         <p>Paste the link to your repository into the text-field under "Remote repository". 
            Modify by adding <code>user:password</code>, and an <code>@</code>-sign added : <br>
            <code style = "margin-left: 15px">   https://USER:PASSWORD@github.com/USERNAME/REPOSITORY_NAME.git</code>.<br>
            In the pasted link,  <br>
            <code style = "margin-left: 15px">USER</code> , <code>PASSWORD</code> , <code>USERNAME</code> , <code>REPOSITORY_NAME</code> <br>
            are exchanged with their proper values.  For instance :<br>
            <code style = "margin-left: 15px">https://JanAxelssonTest:PASSWORD@github.com/JanAxelssonTest/test.git</code>
         </p>  
         
                                
         <p>The repository is set (and tested) by pressing the  <img style='vertical-align:middle;' src="../images/seturl-button.png"  height="24" > button.
            If the text becomes green, the remote repository is correctly defined.  If the text is red, check carefully for typing errors, and press the 
            "Set" button again.
         </p>     
                                 
         <p>Adjust your remote repository text until the "Set" button creates a green text, then it should work.
         </p>   
                                 
         <p>If git is using a credential manager, you can now remove the password (and ':' character) and test if it now works without storing the password in the link.
         Also, if git forgets the password after a while, you will need to keep the password field or install a credential manager.  Mac and Windows should be fine by default.
         </p>

    <!--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------> 

    <h3>B : The "Branches in selected repository"</h3>  
    
        <p>The branches for a selected repository (in the repository table) are listed in all but the last row.  </p>
        
        <p>A branch may be deleted, obviously something you only do if you are done working on that branch.  This could mean 
        either that 1) you have merged your work to another branch, or 2) that your work led to a dead-end and you wish to discard it.  
        Press the "Delete" button, and confirm in the dialog poping up if you wish to delete this branch, or cancel. </p>
        
        <p>In the last row, you can add a new branch, by typing its name, and pressing the "Add branch" button.  
        The branch name cannot contain all characters, so the text field stops you from typing forbidden characters </p>

<h2 class="instructHeader">Section "Software Settings"</h2> 
<hr>                                 
<!--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------> 
    <p>These are the software settings : 
        <dl>
            <dt><b>Visual</b></dt>
                <dd><b>- Dark mode setting </b> , changes the visual theme (requires restart of Pragma-git).  Options are:
                    <ul>
                        <li>System setting : follow the light/dark theme set in the system</li>

                    </ul>
                 </dd>
                <dd><b>- Always on top </b> , makes the main window always be on top of other program windows </dd>
                <br>
                <dd><b>- Show on all workspaces </b> , shows the Pragma-git on all virtual workspaces (this is a Mac and Linus thing) </dd>
                <br>
                <br>
                
                
            <dt><b>Git Settings</b></dt> 
                <br>
                                         
                <dd><b>- Author's name </b> : 
                    Required field. Modify your name (on all your repositories on this computer)</dd>
                <br>
                                             
                <dd><b>- Author's email </b> : 
                    Modify your email (on all your repositories on this computer)</dd>
                <br>
                
                <dd><b>- Branch change only if all files are stored </b> : 
                    Stops you from changing branch, if you have not Stored your data.  This is the safe way to work. </dd>
                <br>
                
                <dd><b>- Auto-push to remote when Store clicked </b> : 
                    The "Store" button performs the git commands "Add", "Commit", and if this setting is selected "Push". Disabling stops the "Push" command from being automatically run </dd>
                <br>

                                             
                <dd><b>- Merge without fast-forward </b> : 
                    This is default, and makes clearer merges.  This guarantees that a commit is created when merging,
                    where the commit message can clarify the used workflow.  This is the recommended workflow in the popular "Gitflow" way to do branching.
                    It is also recommended to enable this setting because searches will be easier to understand (see below setting).</dd>
                <br>
                                             
                <dd><b>- Search in current branch </b> : 
                    This is default, and makes search look in current branch.  This makes searches less confusing, since the 
                    result follow a logical flow, and does not jump back and forth between branches.
                    However: Results where fast-forward merge (above setting) are used will be confusing, 
                    and if fast-forward-merges are your settings, it is recommended to disable the "Search in current branch" 
                    setting.   <dd>
                <br>

                    
                <br>
                
                
            <dt><b>Git tools</b></dt>
                <p> Pragma-git has a built-in diff and merge tool.  
                If the fields for external tools are left blank (or says <code>pragma-git</code>), the built-in tool will be used.</p>
                 If you have your favorite Diff and Merge tool it may be used instead. 
                 <br>
                There are numerous such tools to chose from (search internet for : Diff and Merge tool). Some that are listed in the git help
                are : meld, kdiff3, kompare, tkdiff,  xxdiff, emerge, gvimdiff, ecmerge, diffuse, opendiff, p4merge and araxis.
                Meld exists for Windows, Mac, and Linux, but there are many platform specific tools that may be equally good, or even suit you better.
                The settings for external tools are :
                 <br>
                
                <br>
                <dd><b>- Diff tool </b> , lets Pragma-git show you differences between different revisions. The diff-program must be installed separately.  One good diff program is "Meld", but there are tens of different programs to download </dd>
                <br>
                <dd><b>- Merge tool </b> , lets Pragma-git help you solve file conflicts where git cannot decide safely on its own (conflicts arising from Merges, or Pull from remote repository where work has been done in both places)  </dd>
                <br>
                <dd><b>- Addition to path </b> , if the external diff/merge tools do not open, their path may not be accessible to Pragma-git.  
                    This can be fixed, by adding the path to the tools in this field.
                    If you have different diff and merge tools, two paths may be needed.
                    The two paths should then be separated by "<code>;</code>" for Windows, or "<code>:</code>" for Mac and Linux.
                </dd>
