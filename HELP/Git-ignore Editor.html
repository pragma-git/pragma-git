<h2>The Pragma-git ignore editor</h2>

    <p>
    Creating properly working git-ignore rules is sometimes hard. Therefore Pragma-git has an editor, with a preview window, so that you can see what happens.

<h2 class="instructHeader">Ignore files in Git</h2>
    
    <p>
    Git can be configured to ignore files in your repository-folder from being included into the repository.
    It is good practice to ignore some files and directories.  Examples of such files are:
        <ul>
            <li><b>Dependencies </b>, libraries etc (for instance node_modules in node.js)</li>
            <li><b>Generated files </b>, for instance compiled code and other output generated at build time (jar files, class files, exe files, /bin folder, ...)</li>
            <li><b>Log files </b>, and other files generated at run time</li>
            <li><b>System files </b>, for instance .DS_Store, </li>
            <li><b>Login credentials </b>, for instance passwords, access keys, ... </li>
        </ul>
    
     that are eithgenerated when running or compiling your software (log files, compiled files, etc).
    </p>
          
 
<!--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------> 
<hr>      
 
<h2>Ignore files</h2>

    <p>
    Git knows when a new file is created in the file system.  
    These steps are followed to decide if this file should be listed as changed, and therefore a candidate to be added to the repository :
        <ol>
            <li><b>If the file is tracked </b> (has been added to the repository previously), then the file is added to git for inclusion in next commit</li>
            <li><b>If the file is not tracked </b>  (is not already in the repository), then git decides depending on the rules in the file <code>.gitignore</code> </li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    
 
<!--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------> 
<hr>  
 
<h2>Format of .ignore rules</h2>
    
    <p>
    The complete documentation of the can be found here <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore">https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore</a> 
    </p>
    
    
    <p>
    A summary of the format for rules in <code>.gitignore</code> are:
    </p>
    
    
    <table>
        <th>example</th><th>what is ignored</th>
        
        <tr>
            <td><code>.DS_Store</code></td>
            <td>Ignore exact file name <code>.DS_Store</code></td>
        </tr>
        
        <tr>
            <td><code>node_modules/</code></td>
            <td>Ignore directory <code>node_modules</code> and everything below (because the <code>/</code>)</td>
        </tr>
        
        
        <tr>
            <td><code># This is a comment</code></td>
            <td>A comment. Comments must be on a separate line, with the first character <code>#</code>)</td>
        </tr>
        
        
        <tr>
            <td><code>*.txt</code></td>
            <td>Ignore all files ending with <code>.txt</code><br>
                <code>*</code> is a wildcard matching zero or more characters
            </td>
        </tr>
        
        
        <tr>
            <td><code>!README.txt</code></td>
            <td><code>!</code> means <b>not</b><br>
            So, <code>README.txt</code> will not be ignored</td>
        </tr>
    
    </table>
    
    <br>

<h2 id="alreadyTrackeFileHelp">Already tracked files </h2>
    
    <p>
    The following statement (from above) explains why the git (and the preview) may not behave as expected :
    <blockquote>
    "<b>If the file is tracked </b> (has been added to the repository previously), then the file is added to git for inclusion in next commit"
    </blockquote>
    </p>
    
    
    <p>
    If you wish all your files to follow the rules, then you need to re-track the files.  This means, to remove the files from the repository,
    and then add them according to the <code>.gitignore</code> rules. This is done by the button  <button > Retrack <img height="12" width="12"  src="../images/warning.png"></button>. 
    </p>
    
    
    <p>
    There are a few consequenses to be aware of:
         <ul>
            <li><b>Some files were untracked</b>, and will now be listed as deleted before you store.  
                This is correct behavior, and if that is intended, allow this.
                It is indicated in the preview list, by the text <code>(untracked)</code>
            </li>
            <li><b>Ignored files</b> will be on your computer, but will not be pushed to the remote folder. Neither will they be pulled from the remote repository. 
                Be aware, and proceed if you indeed want to remove the files from the repository
            </li>
            <li><b>May take some time</b>, if a folder with a large number of files is removed from the ignore editor. 
            This is indicated by a spinning progress indicator. Be patient, because this operation will continue also if you close the window.
            Normally, if you don't remove a folder with thousands of files in the .gitignore editor, the operation is fast.
            </li>
            <li><b>Reset</b>, resets the <code>.gitignore</code> file, which can be previewed.  It cannot undo a Retrack.
            </li>
        </ul>
           
    </p>
    
  <b>Retrack</b>, is considered safe, and is simply the two git commands: <br>
                <code>git rm -rf --cached .</code><br>
                <code>git add .</code>

    
    <br>
    
    <br>
