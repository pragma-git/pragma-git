    <p>
    The idea with the Notes is to have one handy place to keep track of ideas, todo lists, etc. 
    </p> 
         
    <p>
    There is one Notes sheet per repository (same Notes for all branches) 
    </p>  
 
<br>
 <h4>Saving</h4>       
    <p>
    There is no manual save. Notes are auto-saved regularly, and are also saved when window is closed. 
    </p>  

  
    <p>
    The Notes sheet is saved in the pragma-git settings folder, on the local computer. 
    The location of the settings folder for this computer can be found from the section System Info, in the Settings ( <img style='vertical-align:middle;' src="../images/settings_black.png"  height="14" width="14"> )
    The file name will be the same as for the repository folder (but with an extension of <code>.md</code>), so if that folder is renamed also the notes file has to be renamed.
    </p>

 <h4>WYSIWYG or Markdown</h4>  

    <p>
    With <b>WYSIWYG</b> button enabled - the editor works in a visual mode, hiding the markdown notation. 
    </p> 

    <p>
    With <b>Markdown</b> button enabled - the editing is performed in markdown notation in the left window pane. A visual non-editable preview is shown in the right pane. 
    </p> 
     
    <p>
    Notes are saved in markdown notation. 
    </p>  

<br>
 <h4>Toolbar</h4>       
    <p>
    There are a number of self-explanatory buttons at the toolbar.  Hovering over a button gives a brief explanation.  
    These buttons are used to insert and format elements, and work both in visual and markdown mode. 
    </p>  

    
    <p>
    There is also a search function ( <img style='vertical-align:middle;' src="../images/find_black.png"  height="14" width="14"> )
    and a way to go back to earlier saved versions  ( <img style='vertical-align:middle;' src="../images/history_black.png"  height="14" width="14"> )
    </p>

 <h4>Tricks for list items and check boxes</h4> 
    <p>
        Check boxes, point lists or numbered lists are all lists, which behave similarly. 
    </p>  
    
    <ul>
        <li>
            Pressing [Enter] creates a new section.
        </li>
        <li>
            A new line can be forced <u>within</u> a list item by pressing [Shift]+[Enter].
        </li>
        <li>
            Empty lines within a list item are automatically removed.  Adding a period (".") is a workaround to keep a line without text
        </li>
    </ul>
        
    </p>

<h4>Get back old version of Notes</h4>  
    <p>
    Notes are also saved incrementally with a time stamp. Saving happens when the Notes window is closed. 
    This is achieved by letting the settings folder be its own local git repository.
    </p>
    
    
    <p>
    To find an older version of a file click the <img style='vertical-align:middle;' src="../images/history_black.png"  height="14" width="14"> 
    icon, and a navigation menu for old versions appears :   

    </p>
    
    <style>
        .myButton {
            margin: 10px;
            font-size: 13px;
            border: 1px solid #dadde6;
            padding: 5px;
        }
        
        .notes-popup-text {
            color: var(--notes-popup-text);
            font-weight: 600;
        }
        
        .toastui-editor-popup-body {
            background-color: white;
            width: fit-content;
            padding: 10px;
            text-align: center;
        }
    </style>
    
    <div class="toastui-editor-popup-body">
        <div aria-label="Previous versions of this file">
    
            <div class="toastui-editor-button-container" style="text-align: center; margin: 0px">
                <span class="notes-popup-text">Version: </span><br>
                <button id="back" class="myButton" onClick="olderVersion();">Older</button><br>
                <button id="forward" class="myButton" onClick="newerVersion();">Newer</button><br>
                
                <div id="info" class="notes-popup-text" style="text-align: center;" > latest <br> </div><br>
                
                <button id="original" class="myButton" onClick="resetHistory();">Original</button>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
    
    <p> The menu is closed by clicking the <img style='vertical-align:middle;' src="../images/history_black.png"  height="14" width="14"> 
    icon again, or by clicking outside the menu.
    </p>
    
    <p> 
    When you close the menu the text seen in the window becomes the current, and thus overwrite what you had previously written.
    The previous state of the window is stored in the history.
    </p>
