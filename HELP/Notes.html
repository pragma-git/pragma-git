    <p>
    The idea with the Notes is to have one handy place to keep track of ideas, todo lists, etc. 
    </p> 
         
    <p>
    There is one Notes sheet per repository (same Notes for all branches) 
    </p>  

 <h4>Saving</h4>       
    <p>
    There is no manual save. Notes are auto-saved regularly, and are also saved when window is closed. 
    </p>  

  
    <p>
    The Notes sheet is saved in the pragma-git settings folder, on the local computer. 
    The location of the settings folder for this computer can be found from the section System Info, in the Settings ( <img style='vertical-align:middle;' src="../images/settings_black.png"  height="14" width="14"> )
    The file will be the same as for the repository folder, so if that folder is renamed also the notes file has to be renamed.
    </p>  

   
 <h4>WYSIWYG or Markdown</h4>  

    <p>
    With <b>WYSIWYG</b> button enabled - the editor works in a visual mode, hiding the markdown notation. 
    </p> 

    <p>
    With <b>Markdown</b> button enabled - the editing is performed in markdown notation in the left window pane. A visual non-editable preview is shown in the right pane. 
    </p> 
     
    <p>
    Notes are saved in markdown notation. 
    </p>  


 <h4>Toolbar</h4>       
    <p>
    There are a number of self-explanatory buttons at the toolbar.  Hovering over a button gives a brief explanation.  
    These buttons are used to insert and format elements, and work both in visual and markdown mode. 
    </p>  

    
    <p>
    There is also a search function ( <img style='vertical-align:middle;' src="../images/find_black.png"  height="14" width="14"> )
    </p>  


 <h4>Tricks for list items and check boxes</h4> 
    <p>
        Check boxes, point lists or numbered lists are all lists, which behave similarly. 
    </p>  
    
    <ul>
        <li>
            Pressing [Enter] creates a new section.
        </li>
        <li>
            A new line can be forced <u>within</u> a list item by pressing [Shift]+[Enter].
        </li>
        <li>
            Empty lines within a list item are automatically removed.  Adding a period (".") is a workaround to keep a line without text
        </li>
    </ul>
        
    </p> 
    
    
    

<h4>Get back old version of Notes</h4>  
    <p>
    Notes are also saved incrementally with a time stamp, when the Notes window is closed. 
    This is achieved by letting the settings folder be its own local git repository.
    </p>
    
    
    <p>
    To find an older version of a file, add the settings folder to the repository list. This is done just as for adding any repository; 
    through settings, or by drag and drop onto main window.  Then navigate
    to an older version the same way as for other repositories.     
    </p>
