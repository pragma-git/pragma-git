       
        <p>You are in this window because there are file conflicts, most likely caused by a 
        Merge <img src="../images/merge_black.png"  height="17" width="17"> or 
        Stash-pop <img src="../images/stash_pop_black.png"  height="17" width="auto">  operation.
         The reason is that a file has been deleted or modified in one place, or
         that there are differences in overlapping parts of a file.  These cases needs a manual intervention, to decide which change to keep.
        </p>   
        
        <h2>If you want to undo what caused the conflict</h2>
        <p>
        
        Press <button>Undo Merge</button> in case you wish to undo the Merge or Stash-pop operation <br>
        (or the Stash pop, which has caused the conflict because a merge is part of that operation)
        </p>
        <br>
        
        <h2>If you want to solve the conflict</h2>
        
        <h4>Each type of conflict is solved in a different section</h4>
            <p>Resolve the conflicts starting at the top section. You may fold the sections, by clicking on the header.  
            </p>
        
        <h4>Section "1) Select files to keep"</h4>
            <p> The files listed here were in a state where it could not be determined if they should be kept, or deleted.  
            Check files you wish to keep, and click the button :
            </p>      
            <button>Keep checked files (delete others)</button>
           
        <h4>Section "2) Conflicting files"</h4>
            <p> Clicking the <button>Solve conflicting files</button> button starts a merge tool (see Requirements, below).
            This button will be enabled after step 1) above is done.
            </p>
            
            <p> The merge tool will be opened one time for each conflicting file. 
            If you click 'Save' button in the opened merge tool, your conflict resolution is accepted.  
            </p><p>
            If you click 'Cancel' in the merge tool, the file will remain in a conflicting state.  
            In that case, you need to repeat clicking the <button>Solve conflicting files</button> button again.
            </p>            
            

        
        <h4>Section "3) Accept changes"</h4>
            <p>This is your last chance to change your mind.  <br>
            <ul>
                <li>Press <button>Undo Merge</button> in case you are not sure the conflict was resolved correctly </li>
                <li style="padding-top:4px">Press <button>Click to Accept</button> to finish.  (This will also remove some backup-files created when working with the conflicts)</li>
            </ul>
            NOTE : After this, you should type a commit description and press the Store-button in the main window
            </p>
            
            
            
            
        
        <h4>Requirements</h4>
