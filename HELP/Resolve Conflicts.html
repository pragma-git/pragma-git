         that there are differences in overlapping parts of two files.  Both these cases needs a manual choice, which change to keep.
        </p>   
        
        <h4>This window has a stepwise approach</h4>
            <p>Resolve the conflicts one section at a time. You may fold the sections, by clicking on the header.  
            </p>
        
        <h4>Section "1) Select files to keep"</h4>
            <p> The files listed here were in a state where it could not be determined if they should be kept, or deleted.  Check files you wish to keep.
            </p>      
           
        <h4>Section "2) Conflicting files"</h4>
            <p> Clicking the "Solve conflicting files"-button starts an external merge tool (see Requirements, below).
            This button will be enabled when there are no conflicts in step 1).
            </p>

        
        <h4>Section "3) Accept changes"</h4>
            <p>This is your last chance to change your mind.  <br>
            Press "Undo Merge" in case you do not accept. <br>
            Press "Click to Accept" to finish.  (This will also remove some backup-files created when working with the conflicts)<br><br>
            NOTE : After this, you should type a description and press the Store-button in the main window
