        Merge <img src="../images/merge_black.png"  height="17" width="17"> or 
        Stash-pop <img src="../images/stash_pop_black.png"  height="17" width="auto">  operation.
         The reason is that a file has been deleted or modified in one place, or
         that there are differences in overlapping parts of a file.  These cases needs a manual intervention, to decide which change to keep.
        </p>
