  <h4>What is a Stored Detached HEAD?</h4>       
    <p>
    If you go back in history, and checkout a commit, you are recommended only to look around, and make experimental changes.
    If you have stored (commited) one or more change, and want to return to the top of your working branch, your work may be lost.
    </p> 
         

  <h4>What to do?</h4>           
         
         
    <p>
    In above situation, Pragma-git gives you a chance to either delete, or to save your work 
    (in a new branch, or merge it to an existing branch).  
    </p>  
     
    <p>
    1) To create and save into a new branch, you select this radiobutton:     
    </p>  


     
    <p class="indent">
        <label for="tempBranch">
            <input type="radio" id="tempBranch" name="detachedBranchRadiobuttonGroup1" value="Temp Branch" checked="">
            Temp branch : move work to a temporary branch
        </label>
 
    </p>  


     
    <p>
    2) To merge into an existing branch, you select this radiobutton:     </p>  


     
    <p class="indent">
        <label for="mergeWithBranch">
            <input type="radio" id="mergeWithBranch" name="detachedBranchRadiobuttonGroup2" value="Merge" checked="">
            Merge : merge work into branch 
            
            <!-- This select is just used to indicate that it is a drop-down -- menu is displayed another way (so therefore mouse-down is disabled) --> 
            <select name="mergeWithDetachedBranchLink" id="mergeWithDetachedBranchLink" >
                <option id="detachedBranchDialogMergeWith" value="anything">main</option>
            </select>
            
        </label>
        
    </p>  


     
    <p class="indent">
        The default branch is the one you checked out from, but you may change to any other branch with the dropdown menu 
            <select name="mergeWithDetachedBranchLink" id="mergeWithDetachedBranchLink" >
                <option id="detachedBranchDialogMergeWith" value="anything">...</option>
            </select>
 
    </p>  

     
    <p>
    3) To delete the work performed after the checkout, you select this radiobutton:    
    </p>  


     
    <p class="indent">
        <label for="deleteDetachedHead">
            <input type="radio" id="deleteDetachedHead" name="detachedBranchRadiobuttonGroup3" value="Delete" checked="">
            Delete : discard work saved to detached HEAD
        </label>
 
    </p>  

     
    <p>
    After pressing <button>OK</button>, the selected action is performed, and you are back to the top of the previous branch
    (or if you selected another branch in 2), to the top of that branch)
    </p>  
     
    <p>
    If the option 2 (merge into an existing branch) was selected, it is as with any merge a risk of a merge conflict.
    Pragma-git will guide you on how to resolve such a conflict.
    </p>
