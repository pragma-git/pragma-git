  <h4>What is Github</h4>       
    <p>
    Github is a remote git-repository. 
    You may connect your local repository to this, and can use this as a backup, to keep different computers
    you work with in sync, or for cooperation with others.
    </p> 

 
 <h4>Setup</h4>       
    <p>
    Github requires an account (that is, a username), and a password. The location of the remote github repository 
    is defined by an URL, of a format similar to "<code>https://...github.com..</code>".  This window helps you getting this correct.
    </p>  

  
    <p>
    A new account can be defined from the github website, by following the link "Register a Github account".
    </p> 

    <p>
    An access token can also be defined from the github website, by following the link "Create an access token". 
    The access token can act as a password for git, and give access to operations such as creating a new repository from within Pragma-git. 
    </p>  

    <p>
    When creating an access token fill in the form on the github web-page (opened from the "Create an access token" link) :

        <dl>
            <dt>Note
                <dd>type "pragma-git", or anything else that reminds you of why the token was created

            
            <dt>Repo checkbox
                <dd>must be selected
                    
            <dt>User checkbox
                <dd>must be selected
                
            <dt><button>Generate Token</button> button 
                <dd>end by pressing this button to generate an access token
            
        </dl>
        
    
        Finally, copy the token from the page, and paste it into the field "Access Token" (Pragma-git Github window).
    </p>  

 <h4>The URL</h4>  
    <p>
    This form in this window helps you to compose the correct URL from fields for username, access token, and existing repository.
    A generated URL preview is shown below these fields. 
    
    </p> 

    <p>
    <button>Close, Update Setting</button> button closes this window and updates the URL in the settings window.
    
    </p> 

    <p>
    <button>Cancel</button>  button leaves the window keeping the old URL in the settings window.
    </p> 
 
 
 <h4>Create a Remote Github Repository</h4>  

    <p>
    As said before, this can be done via github's website.  However, this window makes the process simpler.   
    The fields in this section are:

        <dl>
            <dt>Private repository
            <dd>a checkbox that makes the repository visible to only you and others 
                who you have given your username, password and access token.
            <dt>Name of New Repository
                <dd>is obvious. This field inhibits forbidden characters to be typed, 
                and exchanges others to allowed characters. This must be a new repository name, that does not already exist on your github account.
    
            <dt>Description
                <dd>is a short text describing your repository, displayed in the github web-view.
        </dl>
        
    </p> 
        
    <p>
        <button>Create New Remote Repository</button> button creates a new repository
        in you account (requires correct username and access token fields). 
    </p> 
     

 <h4>Finish the Remote Repository creation</h4>          
    <p>
        A status message is shown below the buttons, displaying success or failure.
        When succesful, the repository name is copied to the "Existing Repository Name" field.
    </p> 
    
    <p>
    <button>Close, Update Setting</button> button closes this window and updates the URL in the settings window.
    </p> 

    <p>
    <button>Cancel</button>  button (higher up on the page) leaves the window keeping the old URL in the settings window.
    </p>
