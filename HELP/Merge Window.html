 


  <h4>Introduction</h4>       
    <p>
    This window shows differences between two commits.  It can also be used as a difference editor, where uncommited files can be compared to a previous state, and each change can be edited.
    </p> 
         
    <p>
    This window is also activated when conflicts between file versions are found in merges between two branches, or between the remote and the local repository.
    </p>  
 
 <h4>Frames -- diff viewer/editor</h4>       
    <p>
    In difference mode, 2 frames are shown.  
    They are titled according to their function (new / stored / selected / previous). 
    Generally speaking, the left frame displays the modified file and the right the already stored file.
    </p>

        <figcaption  class="fig_multiline">
                Lines with differences are highlighted, and the characters changed are shown by red and green underlinings.  
                In the left pane, a green underline means that the characters are new, and in the right pane, a red underline means that a character has been removed.

 <h4>Frames -- merge editor</h4> 
      
    <p>
    In merge mode, you can select to see 2 or 3 frames (<button>two-way</button>  or <button>three-way</button> button).  2 frames works as in difference mode.  
    In 3 frame mode, the middle frame is the result from your merge, and changes can be selected to be moved into the middle frame from either of the two files displayed in left and right frames.
    </p>  
      
    
 <h4>Editing</h4>       
    <p>
    When editing or merging of two versions is allowed, small arrows can be clicked to copy the adjacent rows.   
    </p>     
     
    <p>
    To select all differences from one version, use the <button>â‡œ all</button>.  If you accidentally do that, start over by pressing the <button>Reload</button> button.
    </p>  


 <h4>Save</h4>  
      
    <p>
    If you have modified the files with the diff or merge tool, you need to press the <button>Save</button> button. <br>
    You may also use the keyboard shortcuts <button>&#8984;</button> + <button>S</button>
    or <button>Ctrl</button> + <button>S</button>.
    </p> 

 
    <p>
    File saving is cancelled if you press <button>Cancel</button> button, or close the window any other way.
    </p>

 <h4>Message 
    "<span id='showExecutableBitDiffers' style="border-bottom-style: solid">Note: executable bit differs</span>"
</h4>       
    <p>
       This message indicates that the executable bit (chmod +x command on linux and MacOS) is different between the files.
    </p>  
    <p>
       When executable bit differs between files, the title above the code panes 
       (showing : new / stored / selected / previous) is amended showing the executable bit status.<br>
       <code>(x+)</code> means that the file is executable.  <br>
       <code>(x-)</code>  that it is non-executable.
    </p>
