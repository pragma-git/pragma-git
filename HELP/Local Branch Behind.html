  <h4>Local and Remote branch out of sync</h4>       
    <p>
    This problem may occur when more than one developer work on the same branch.
    The first developer may have pushed work to remote, while the second developer has made own changes. Thus remote and the local repository are out of sync.
    </p> 
    
  
    <p>
    Another occurance is that if one user changes a commit (either editing the message, or amending more work to the same commit).  
    Both these operations changes the remote, and as above, the other programmer's local repository becomes out of sync with remote.
    </p> 
         

  <h4>What to do?</h4>           
         
         
    <p>
    In above situation, Pragma-git gives you two options: 
    </p>  
     
    <p>
    1) Best practice:  Combine a pull from remote (thus updating the local repository), with a push.  
   
    </p>  


     
    <p class="indent">
        <label for="tempBranch">
            <input type="radio" id="tempBranch" name="detachedBranchRadiobuttonGroup1" value="Temp Branch" checked="">
            Get remote, and push (pull --rebase, and push)
        </label>
 
    </p>  


     
    <p>
    2) Force push, overwriting the remote with the local repository.  
    This is dangerous, because it deletes commits from remote that did not exist on local </p>  


     
    <p class="indent">
        <label for="mergeWithBranch">
            <input type="radio" id="mergeWithBranch" name="detachedBranchRadiobuttonGroup2" value="Merge" checked="">
            Force push -- overwrite remote commits (dangerous)
            

            
        </label>
        
    </p>  



     
    <p>
    After pressing <button>OK</button>, the selected action is performed
    </p>
