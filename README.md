Pragma-git
==========

 

*Pragma-git* is a friendly pragmatic *git* control app, *fully compatible* with
other git client softwares.

 

### The aim with *Pragma-git* is to be

-   ”pragmatic” — aiming to be the opposite to how many beginners perceive *git*

-   easy to start — and something to grow in for daily programming tasks

-   friendly — guiding you through risks of data loss with pop-up warnings and
    instructions

 

### Differences to other git clients

-   small window — no need hiding other apps

-   easy overview of project state

-   show buttons only when applicable — less confusion

-   use built-in or external diff and merge tools — use your favourite

-   note taking — todo lists and notes at your finger tips
